# Movie-Ratings-Analysis-
Welcome to my project on movie ratings analysis! This is one of the projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of my Udacity internship program. The project involves working with real movie data to explore and analyze various aspects such as runtime, genres, cast, and ratings.
## Key Features
Data Cleaning: Ensured data quality and addressed missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive analysis to uncover trends and relationships.
Visualization: Created various plots, including bar charts and box plots, to present findings.

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the detailed analysis and visualizations. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
